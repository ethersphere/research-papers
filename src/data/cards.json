    "pdf": "https://www.ethswarm.org/swarm-whitepaper.pdf",
    "content": "The Swarm Whitepaper describes the architecture and operational details of the Swarm network. It is aimed at introducing Swarm to a wide audience of readers, especially developers, technologists and researchers keen on learning about Swarm. Included in the paper is a description of the Distributed Immutable Store of Chunks (DISC), emphasising scalability, privacy and resilience, as well as Swarm's API functionalities, such as file management and messaging. The paper also elaborates on Swarm’s blockchain-based economic model and highlights the role of the BZZ token. This whitepaper is a crucial read for those aiming to gain a comprehensive technical insight into Swarm's role in fostering a digitally autonomous society."

    "content": "This document provides a technical exploration of erasure coding in the Swarm network, focusing on ensuring data integrity and resilience. It details the implementation of Reed-Solomon coding within Swarm's hash tree structure for robust data storage and recovery. The paper is ideal for developers and engineers seeking a deep understanding of Swarm's data handling mechanisms, particularly in scenarios of network faults and attacks. Key aspects include handling incomplete data sets and optimizing retrieval strategies, making it a critical read for those involved in the technical aspects of decentralised data storage."

    "pdf": "/dream-1.pdf",
    "content": "This work introduces DREAM, a novel construct that enables deletable content in otherwise immutable, decentralized storage systems such as Swarm. The paper contributes a new deletion model that is based on access revocation and presents a mechanism that allows data-sharing users to grant and later rescind access to specific data to specific consumers. The solution leverages Swarm’s distributed storage architecture to introduce a distributed one-time pad mechanism realized by a network protocol."
